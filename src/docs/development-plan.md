   - Include both unit and integration tests
   - Add end-to-end tests for critical paths

2. **Documentation**:
   - Document APIs as they're built
   - Maintain user documentation
   - Keep development notes updated

3. **Code Quality**:
   - Regular code reviews
   - Maintain consistent styling
   - Performance monitoring

4. **Deployment Strategy**:
   - Staged deployments (dev, staging, prod)
   - Feature flags for gradual rollout
   - Regular backup system
